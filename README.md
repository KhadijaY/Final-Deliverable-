# Introduction
Our project is looking at the incidence rates of COVID-19  within our nations states and more specifically its impacts on the racial demographics within them. The dataset we used is directly collected from the CDC study titled ' Distribution of COVID-19 Deaths and Populations, by Judrisdiction, Age, and Race and Hispanic Origin'. This dataset has effectively shown us the Distribution of COVID death rates by race and has allowed us to compare and contrast cateogories in depth as you will see within our interactive pages. The questions we seek to answer are:

1. "How does the difference in weighted distribution of populations within the states affect the incidence rates of COVID-19?" 

2."Which racial demographics have the highest/lowest COVID-19 incidence rates?"

3."What variations are seen in terms of the distrubtion of COVID-19 deaths?"

# Summary-Takeaways

Using the barplot above of the data, we were able to make a visual observation that higher rates of deaths due to covid appear to be most prevelent in the white population. While Non-hispanic and Black populations followed closely second and third, showing that they were also heavily impacted by COVID-19.

With the use of the shiny app and this dataset we were able to create three different graphs (Bar, Density,and Scatterplot) that allowed us to analyze the dataset with much more depth. Some things that we found while analyzing states data as compared to demographic, it was clear that COVID impacts by deaths varied in race, possibly due to varations in population. For example, the dataset showed that the state with the most COVID deaths was Wyoming, which is a state that has a prodimentaly of a white demographic and thus could account for the higher number of deaths reported by the CDC. When we chose the weighted, We wanted to explore external factors such as socio-economic status, disabilty, and etc. To see how it could contribute to the varying distrubtion with different demographics. However, through research into our data we disovered that there are still limitation within the CDC's data collection. In an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768722), we found that compared the distribution of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity with 2 separate population distribution provided by the CDC and the US Census weighted and unweighted population. Their findings have concluded that people of color have been underrepresented within the collected weighted and unweighed populations, mitigating proper evaluations of the incident rates from COVID-19. This was an evaluation which was also supported by the findings in our dataset. ")
