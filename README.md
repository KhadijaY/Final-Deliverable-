# Introduction

Through further analysis of our dataset we seek to answer the following questions:
 
1. How is the distribution of Covid represented in our dataset? 

2. What variations are seen in terms of the number of deaths due to COVID?

# Summary Takeaways

Using the barplot above of the data, we were able to make a visual observation that higher rates of deaths due to covid appear to be most prevelent in the white population. While Non-hispanic and Black populations followed closely second and third, showing that they were also heavily impacted by COVID-19.


In addition while analyzing states data as compared to demographic, it was clear that COVID impacts by deaths varied in race, possibly due to varations in population. For example, the dataset showed that the state with the most COVID deaths was Wyoming, which is a prodominatly White state and thus could account for the higher number of deaths reported by the CDC. When we chose the weighted, We wanted explore extronal factros such as socio-economic status, disabilty that could contribute to the varying distrubtion with different demographics. However, through research into our data we disovered that there are still limitation within the CDC's data collection. In an [article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2768722) which compared the distribution of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity with 2 separate population distribution provided by the CDC and the US Census weighted and unweighted population. Their findings have concluded that people of color have been underrepresented within the collected weighted and unweighed populations, mitigating proper evaluations of the incident rates from COVID-19. This was an evaluation which was also supported by the findings in our dataset.
